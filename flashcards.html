    ans: `Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
Platform as a service(PaaS)
Software as a service(SaaS)` },
  { que: "Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)",
    ans: `The basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide you with access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is the most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today` },
  { que: "Platform as a service (PaaS)",
    ans: `Services in this category reduce the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and enable you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.` },
  { que: "Software as a service (SaaS)",
    ans: `A completed product that the service provider runs and manages. In most cases, software as a service refers to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You need to think only about how you plan to use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email, where you can send and receive email without managing feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program runs on.` },

A transit gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes.
This HUB-AND-SPOKE model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only needs to connect to the transit gateway and not to every other network.
Any new VPC is connected to the transit gateway, and is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the transit gateway.

Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level.
Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.
At the most basic level, a security group is a way for you to filter traffic to your instances.When you create a custom security group, you can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
All rules are evaluated before the decision to allow traffic.` },
  { que: "Network access control list (network ACL)",
    ans: `An optional layer of security for your Amazon VPC. It acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.To add another layer of security to your VPC, you can set up network ACLs with rules that are similar to your security groups.
Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL.
If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.
When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
Network ACLs are STATELESS, which means that no information about a request is maintained after a request is processed.` },

Amazon CloudFront delivers files to users over a global network of edge locations and Regional edge caches.
Amazon CloudFront is different from traditional content delivery solutions because it enables you to quickly obtain the benefits of high-performance content delivery without negotiated contracts, high prices, or minimum fees.
Like other AWS services, Amazon CloudFront is a self-service offering with pay-as-you-go pricing.
AmazonCloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers that are called EDGE LOCATIONS.
When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (or time delay) so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
CloudFront edge locations are designed to serve popular content quickly to your viewers.
As objects become less popular, individual edge locations might remove those objects to make room for more popular content.
For the less popular content, CloudFront has REGIONAL EDGE CACHES.` },
  { que: "REGIONAL EDGE CACHES",
    ans: `Are CloudFront locations that are deployed globally and are close to your viewers.
They are located between your origin server and the global edge locations that serve content directly to viewers.
A Regional edge cache has a larger cache than an individual edge location, so objects remain in the Regional edge cache longer.
More of your content remains closer to your viewers, which reduces the need for CloudFront to go back to your origin server and improves overall performance for viewers.` },

  { que: "Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle",
    ans: `Pending - When an instance is first launched from an AMI, or when you start a stopped instance, it enters the pending state when the instance is booted and deployed to a host computer. The instance type that you specified at launch determines the hardware of the host computer for your instance.
Running - When the instance is fully booted and ready, it exits the pending state and enters the running state. You can connect over the internet to your running instance.
Rebooting - AWS recommends you reboot an instance by using the Amazon EC2 console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs instead of invoking a reboot from within the guest operating system (OS). A rebooted instance stays on the same physical host, maintains the same public DNS name and public IP address, and if it has INSTANCE STORE volumes, it retains the data on those volumes.
Shutting down - This state is an intermediary state between running and terminated.
Terminated - A terminated instance remains visible in the Amazon EC2 console for a while before the virtual machine is deleted. However, you can’t connect to or recover a terminated instance.
Stopping - Instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can be stopped. They enter the stopping state before they attain the fully stopped state.
Stopped - A stopped instance will not incur the same cost as a running instance. Starting a stopped instance puts it back into the pending state, which moves the instance to a new host machine.` },

  { que: "Amazon EC2 pricing models: Use cases",
    ans: `ON-DEMAND Instance: pricing works well for SPIKY workloads or if you only need to test or run an application for a short time (for example, during application development or testing). Sometimes, your workloads are unpredictable, and On-Demand Instances are a good choice for these cases.
SPOT Instances: are a good choice if your applications can TOLERATE INTERRUPTION WITH A 2-MINUTE WARNING notification. By default, instances are terminated, but you can configure them to stop or hibernate instead. Common use cases include fault-tolerant applications such as web servers, API backends, and big data processing. Workloads that constantly save data to persistent storage (such as Amazon S3) are also good candidates.
RESERVED Instances: are a good choice when you have LONG-TERM workloads with PREDICTABLE usage patterns, such as servers that you know you will want to run in a consistent way over many months.
DEDICATED Hosts: are a good choice when you have existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses, or when you must address specific corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.` },
  { que: "The four pillars of EC2 cost optimization",

Increase elasticity: design your deployments to reduce the amount of server capacity that is idle by implementing deployments that are elastic, such as deployments that use automatic scaling to handle peak loads.
Optimal pricing model: recognize the available pricing options. Analyze your usage patterns so that you can run EC2 instances with the right mix of pricing options.
Optimize storage choices: analyze the storage requirements of your deployments. Reduce unused storage overhead when possible, and choose less expensive storage options if they can still meet your requirements for storage performance.
