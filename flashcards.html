Platform as a service(PaaS)
Software as a service(SaaS)` },
  { que: "Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)",
    ans: `The basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide you with access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is the most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today` },
  { que: "Platform as a service (PaaS)",
    ans: `Services in this category reduce the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and enable you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications.` },
  { que: "Software as a service (SaaS)",
    ans: `A completed product that the service provider runs and manages. In most cases, software as a service refers to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You need to think only about how you plan to use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email, where you can send and receive email without managing feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program runs on.` },

A transit gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes.
This HUB-AND-SPOKE model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only needs to connect to the transit gateway and not to every other network.
Any new VPC is connected to the transit gateway, and is then automatically available to every other network that is connected to the transit gateway.
This ease of connectivity makes it easier to scale your network as you grow.` },
  { que: "Security group",
    ans: `Acts as a virtual firewall for your instance, and it controls inbound and outbound traffic.
Security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level.
Therefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups.
At the most basic level, a security group is a way for you to filter traffic to your instances.When you create a custom security group, you can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.
All rules are evaluated before the decision to allow traffic.` },
  { que: "Network access control list (network ACL)",
    ans: `An optional layer of security for your Amazon VPC. It acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.To add another layer of security to your VPC, you can set up network ACLs with rules that are similar to your security groups.
Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL.
If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.
When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
Network ACLs are STATELESS, which means that no information about a request is maintained after a request is processed.` },
  { que: "Summary of differences between Security Groups and Network ACLs",
    ans: `Security Groups act at the instance level, but network ACLs act at the subnet level.
Security Groups support allow rules only, but network ACLs support both all and deny rules.
Security Groups are stateful, but network ACLs are stateless.
For Security Groups, all rules are evaluated before the decision is made to allow traffic.
For Network ACLs, rules are evaluated in number order before the decision is made to allow traffic.` },

Like other AWS services, Amazon CloudFront is a self-service offering with pay-as-you-go pricing.
AmazonCloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers that are called EDGE LOCATIONS.
When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (or time delay) so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
CloudFront edge locations are designed to serve popular content quickly to your viewers.
As objects become less popular, individual edge locations might remove those objects to make room for more popular content.
For the less popular content, CloudFront has REGIONAL EDGE CACHES.` },
  { que: "REGIONAL EDGE CACHES",
    ans: `Are CloudFront locations that are deployed globally and are close to your viewers.
They are located between your origin server and the global edge locations that serve content directly to viewers.
A Regional edge cache has a larger cache than an individual edge location, so objects remain in the Regional edge cache longer.
More of your content remains closer to your viewers, which reduces the need for CloudFront to go back to your origin server and improves overall performance for viewers.` },
  { que: "Amazon CloudFront provides the following benefits",
    ans: `Fast and global - Deliver content to end users with low latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network that consists of edge locations and regional caches.

  { que: "Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle",
    ans: `Pending - When an instance is first launched from an AMI, or when you start a stopped instance, it enters the pending state when the instance is booted and deployed to a host computer. The instance type that you specified at launch determines the hardware of the host computer for your instance.
Running - When the instance is fully booted and ready, it exits the pending state and enters the running state. You can connect over the internet to your running instance.
Rebooting - AWS recommends you reboot an instance by using the Amazon EC2 console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs instead of invoking a reboot from within the guest operating system (OS). A rebooted instance stays on the same physical host, maintains the same public DNS name and public IP address, and if it has INSTANCE STORE volumes, it retains the data on those volumes.
Shutting down - This state is an intermediary state between running and terminated.
Terminated - A terminated instance remains visible in the Amazon EC2 console for a while before the virtual machine is deleted. However, you can’t connect to or recover a terminated instance.
Stopping - Instances that are backed by Amazon EBS can be stopped. They enter the stopping state before they attain the fully stopped state.
Stopped - A stopped instance will not incur the same cost as a running instance. Starting a stopped instance puts it back into the pending state, which moves the instance to a new host machine.` },

Increase elasticity: design your deployments to reduce the amount of server capacity that is idle by implementing deployments that are elastic, such as deployments that use automatic scaling to handle peak loads.
Optimal pricing model: recognize the available pricing options. Analyze your usage patterns so that you can run EC2 instances with the right mix of pricing options.
Optimize storage choices: analyze the storage requirements of your deployments. Reduce unused storage overhead when possible, and choose less expensive storage options if they can still meet your requirements for storage performance.

Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
Stop guessing capacity
Manage change in automation`},
  { que: "Automatically recover from failure",
    ans: "Monitor systems for key performance indicators and configure your systems to trigger an automated recovery when a threshold is breached. This practice enables automatic notification and failure-tracking, and for automated recovery processes that work around or repair the failure."},
  { que: "Test recovery procedures",
    ans: "Test how your systems fail and validate your recovery procedures. Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before. This practice can expose failure pathways that you can test and rectify before a real failure scenario."},
  { que: "Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability",
    ans: "Replace one large resource with multiple, smaller resources and distribute requests across these smaller resources to reduce the impact of a single point of failure on the overall system"},

  { que: "Performance Efficiency pillar",
    ans: "focuses on the ability to use IT and computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes or technologies evolve. Key topics include: selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements, monitoring performance, and making informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve."},
  { que: "There are five design principles that can improve PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY",
    ans: `Democratize advanced technologies
Go global in minutes
Use serverless architectures
Experiment more often
Consider mechanical sympathy`},
  { que: "Democratize advanced technologies",
    ans: "Consume technologies as a service. For example, technologies such as NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning require expertise that is not evenly dispersed across the technical community. In the cloud, these technologies become services that teams can consume. Consuming technologies enables teams to focus on product development instead of resource provisioning and management."},
  { que: "Go global in minutes",
    ans: "Deploy systems in multiple AWS Regions to provide lower latency and a better customer experience at minimal cost."},
  { que: "Use serverless architectures",
    ans: "Serverless architectures remove the operational burden of running and maintaining servers to carry out traditional compute activities. Serverless architectures can also lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale."},
  { que: "Experiment more often",
    ans: "Perform comparative testing of different types of instances, storage, or configurations."},
  { que: "Consider mechanical sympathy",
    ans: "Use the technology approach that aligns best to what you are trying to achieve. For example, consider your data access patterns when you select approaches for databases or storage."},
  { que: "Cost Optimization pillar",
    ans: "Focuses on the ability to avoid unnecessary costs. Key topics include: understanding and controlling where money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meeting business needs without overspending."},
  { que: "There are five design principles that can OPTIMIZE COSTS",
    ans: `Implement Cloud Financial Management
Adopt a consumption model
Measure overall efficiency
Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting 
Analyze and attribute expenditure`},
  { que: "Implement Cloud Financial Management",
    ans: "To achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, you need to invest in cloud financial management and cost optimization. You need to build capability through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes to become a cost-efficient organization."},
  { que: "Adopt a consumption model",
    ans: "Pay only for the computing resources that you require. Increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements, not by using elaborate forecasting."},
  { que: "Measure overall efficiency",
    ans: "Measure the business output of the workload and the costs that are associated with delivering it. Use this measure to know the gains that you make from increasing output and reducing costs."},
  { que: "Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting",
    ans: "AWS does the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers, which means that you can focus on your customers and business projects instead of the IT infrastructure."},
  { que: "Analyze and attribute expenditure",
    ans: "The cloud makes it easier to accurately identify system usage and costs, and attribute IT costs to individual workload owners. Having this capability helps you measure return on investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to optimize their resources and reduce costs."},
  { que: "Reliability",
    ans: "A measure of your system’s ability to provide functionality when desired by the user. Because 'everything fails, all the time,' you should think of reliability in statistical terms. Reliability is the probability that an entire system will function as intended for a specified period. Note that a system includes all system components, such as hardware, firmware, and software. Failure of system components impacts the availability of the system."},
  { que: "Availability",
    ans: "The percentage of time that a system is operating normally or correctly performing the operations expected of it (or normal operation time over total time). Availability is reduced anytime the application isn’t operating normally, including both scheduled and unscheduled interruptions"},
  { que: "Three factors that determine the overall availability of your application",
    ans: "Fault tolerance, scalability, recoverabilit"},
  { que: "Fault tolerance:",
    ans: "Refers to the BUILT-IN REDUNDANCY of an application's components and the ABILITY OF THE APPLICATION TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL even if some of its components fail. Fault tolerance relies on specialized hardware to detect failure in a system component (such as a processor, memory board, power supply, I/O subsystem, or storage subsystem) and instantaneously switch to a redundant hardware component. The fault-tolerant model does not address software failures, which are the most common reason for downtime."},
  { que: "Scalability",
    ans: "The ability of your application to accommodate increases in capacity needs, remain available, and perform within your required standards. It does not guarantee availability, but it contributes to your application's availability."},
  { que: "Recoverability",
    ans: "The ability to restore service quickly and without lost data if a disaster makes your components unavailable, or it destroys data."},

Service Limits`},
  { que: "Cost Optimization",
    ans: "AWS Trusted Advisor looks at your resource use and makes recommendations to help you optimize cost by eliminating unused and idle resources, or by making commitments to reserved capacity."},
  { que: "Performance",
    ans: "Improve the performance of your service by checking your service limits, ensuring you take advantage of provisioned throughput, and monitoring for over utilized instances"},
  { que: "Security",
    ans: "Improve the security of your application by closing gaps, enabling various AWS security features, and examining your permissions."},
  { que: "Fault Tolerance",
    ans: "Increase the availability and redundancy of your AWS application by taking advantage of automatic scaling, health checks, Multi-AZ deployments, and backup capabilities."},
  { que: "Service Limit:",
    ans: "AWS Trusted Advisor checks for service usage that is more than 80 percent of the service limit. Values are based on a snapshot, so your current usage might differ. Limit and usage data can take up to 24 hours to reflect any changes."},
  { que: "Elastic Load Balancing:",
    ans: "An AWS service that distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets-such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, internet protocol (IP) addresses, and Lambda functions-in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as traffic to your application changes over time. It can automatically scale to most workloads."},
  { que: "Elastic Load Balancing in three types:",
    ans: `Application Load Balancer
Network Load Balancer
Classic Load Balancer`},
  { que: "Application Load Balancer",
    ans: "Operates at the application level (Open Systems Interconnection, or OSI, model layer 7). It routes traffic to targets—Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and Lambda functions—based on the content of the request. It is ideal for advanced load balancing of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic. An Application Load Balancer provides advanced request routing that is targeted at delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications. An Application Load Balancer simplifies and improves the security of your application by ensuring that the latest Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) ciphers and protocols are used at all times."},
  { que: "Network Load Balancer",
    ans: "Operates at the network transport level (OSI model layer 4), routing connections to targets—EC2instances, microservices, and containers—based on IP protocol data. It works well for load balancing both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic. A Network Load Balancer is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. A Network Load Balancer is optimized to handle sudden and volatile network traffic patterns."},
  { que: "Classic Load Balancer",
    ans: "Provides basic load balancing across multiple EC2instances, and it operates at both the application level and network transport level. A Classic Load Balancer supports the load balancing of applications that use HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL. The Classic Load Balancer is an older implementation.  When possible, AWS recommends that you use a dedicated Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer."},
  { que: "Elastic Load Balancing use cases",
    ans: `Achieve high availability and better fault tolerance for your applications.
Automatically load balance your containerized applications.
Automatically scale your applications.
Use Elastic Load Balancing in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
Enable hybrid load balancing.
Invoking Lambda functions over HTTP(S)`},
  { que: "Achieve high availability and better fault tolerance for your applications",
    ans: "Elastic Load Balancing balances traffic across healthy targets in multiple Availability Zones. If one or more of your targets in a single Availability Zone are unhealthy, Elastic Load Balancing will route traffic to healthy targets in other Availability Zones. After the targets return to a healthy state, load balancing will automatically resume traffic to them."},
  { que: "Automatically load balance your containerized applications",
    ans: "With enhanced container support for Elastic Load Balancing, you can now load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2 instance. You can also take advantage of deep integration with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), which provides a fully-managed container offering. You only need to register a service with a load balancer, and Amazon ECS transparently manages the registration and de-registration of Docker containers. The load balancer automatically detects the port and dynamically reconfigures itself."},
  { que: "Automatically scale your applications",
    ans: "Elastic Load Balancing works with Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to help you scale your applications to the demands of your customers. Amazon CloudWatch alarms can trigger auto scaling for your EC2 instance fleet when the latency of any one of your EC2 instances exceeds a preconfigured threshold. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling then provisions new instances and your applications will be ready to serve the next customer request. The load balancer will register the EC2 instance and direct traffic to it as needed."},
  { que: "Use Elastic Load Balancing in your virtual private cloud (VPC)",
    ans: "You can use Elastic Load Balancing to create a public entry point into your VPC, or to route request traffic between tiers of your application within your VPC. You can assign security groups to your load balancer to control which ports are open to a list of allowed sources. Because Elastic Load Balancing works with your VPC, all your existing network access control lists (network ACLs) and routing tables continue to provide additional network controls. When you create a load balancer in your VPC, you can specify whether the load balancer is public (default) or internal. If you select internal, you do not need to have an internet gateway to reach the load balancer, and the private IP addresses of the load balancer will be used in the load balancer’s Domain Name System (DNS) record."},
  { que: "Enable hybrid load balancing",
    ans: "Elastic Load Balancing enables you to load balance across AWS and on-premises resources by using the same load balancer. For example, if you must distribute application traffic across both AWS and on-premises resources, you can register all the resources to the same target group and associate the target group with a load balancer. Alternatively, you can use DNS-based weighted load balancing across AWS and on-premises resources by using two load balancers, with one load balancer for AWS and other load balancer for on-premises resources. You can also use hybrid load balancing to benefit separate applications where one application is in a VPC and the other application is in an on-premises location. Put the VPC targets in one target group and the on-premises targets in another target group, and then use content-based routing to route traffic to each target group."},
  { que: "Invoking Lambda functions over HTTP(S)",
    ans: "Elastic Load Balancing supports invoking Lambda functions to serve HTTP(S) requests. This enables users to access serverless applications from any HTTP client, including web browsers. You can register Lambda functions as targets and use the support for content-based routing rules in Application Load Balancers to route requests to different Lambda functions. You can use an Application Load Balancer as a common HTTP endpoint for applications that use servers and serverless computing. You can build an entire website by using Lambda functions, or combine EC2 instances, containers, on-premises servers, and Lambda functions to build applications."},
  { que: "Features to monitor your load balancers, analyze traffic patterns, and troubleshoot issues with your load balancers and targets",
    ans: `Amazon CloudWatch metrics
Access logs
AWS CloudTrail logs`},
  { que: "Amazon CloudWatch metrics",
    ans: "Elastic Load Balancing publishes data points to Amazon CloudWatch for your load balancers and your targets. CloudWatch enables you to retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time series data, known as metrics. You can use metrics to verify that your system is performing as expected. For example, you can create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor a specified metric and initiate an action (such as sending a notification to an email address) if the metric goes outside what you consider an acceptable range."},
  { que: "Access logs",
    ans: "You can use access logs to capture detailed information about the requests that were made to your load balancer and store them as log files in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can use these access logs to analyze traffic patterns and to troubleshoot issues with your targets or backend applications."},
  { que: "AWS CloudTrail logs",
    ans: "You can use AWS CloudTrail to capture detailed information about the calls that were made to the Elastic Load Balancing application programming interface (API) and store them as log files in Amazon S3. You can use these CloudTrail logs to determine who made the call, what calls were made, when the call was made, the source IP address of where the call came from, and so on."},
  { que: "Amazon CloudWatch",
    ans: "A monitoring and observability service that is built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers. CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources (and the applications that you run on AWS) in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables that you can measure for your resources and applications."},
  { que: "Amazon CloudWatch: set alarms based on a static threshold",
    ans: `Namespace: A namespace contains the CloudWatch metric that you want, for example, AWS/EC2.
Metric: A metric is the variable you want to measure, for example, CPU Utilization.
Statistic: A statistic can be an average, sum, minimum, maximum, sample count, a predefined percentile, or a custom percentile.
Period: A period is the evaluation period for the alarm. When the alarm is evaluated, each period is aggregated into one data point.
Conditions: When you specify the conditions for a static threshold, you specify whenever the metric is Greater, Greater or Equal, Lower or Equal, or Lower than the threshold value, and you also specify the threshold value.
Additional configuration information: This includes the number of data points within the evaluation period that must be breached to trigger the alarm, and how CloudWatch should treat missing data when it evaluates the alarm.
Actions: You can choose to send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic, or to perform an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling action or Amazon EC2 action.`},
  { que: "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling",
    ans: `Helps you maintain application availability.
Enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions that you define.
Detects impaired EC2 instances and unhealthy applications, and replaces the instances without your intervention.
Provides several scaling options: Manual, scheduled, dynamic or on-demand, and predictive.`},
  { que: "Auto Scaling group",
    ans: "A collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances you set as the DESIRED capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling. "},
  { que: "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: scaling IN vs scaling OUT:",
    ans: "LAUNCHING instances is referred to as scaling OUT, and TERMINATING instances is referred to as scaling IN"},
  { que: "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling options",
    ans: `Maintain current instance levels at all times.
Manual scaling.
Scheduled scaling.
A more advanced way to scale your resources enables you to define parameters that control the scaling process.
Predictive scaling.`},
  { que: "Scaling options: Maintain current instance levels at all time:",
    ans: "You can configure your Auto Scaling group to maintain a specified number of running instances at all times. To maintain the current instance levels, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling performs a periodic health check on running instances in an Auto Scaling group. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling finds an unhealthy instance, it terminates that instance and launches a new one."},
  { que: "Scaling options: Manual scaling",
    ans: "With manual scaling, you specify only the change in the maximum, minimum, or desired capacity of your Auto Scaling group."},
  { que: "Scaling options: Scheduled scaling:",
    ans: "With scheduled scaling, scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of date and time. This is useful for predictable workloads when you know exactly when to increase or decrease the number of instances in your group. For example, saythat every week,the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday."},
  { que: "Scaling options: A more advanced way to scale your resources enables you to define parameters that control the scaling process:",
    ans: "For example, you have a web application that currently runs on two instances and you want the CPU utilization of the Auto Scaling group to stay close to 50 percent when the load on the application changes. This option is useful for scaling in response to changing conditions, when you don't know when those conditions will change. Dynamic scaling gives you extra capacity to handle traffic spikes without maintaining an excessive amount of idle resources. You can configure your Auto Scaling group to scale automatically to meet this need."},
  { que: "Scaling options: Predictive scaling:",
    ans: "You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling with AWS Auto Scaling to implement predictive scaling, where your capacity scales based on predicted demand. Predictive scaling uses data that is collected from your actual EC2 usage, and the data is further informed by billions of data points that are drawn from our own observations. AWS then uses well-trained machine learning models to predict your expected traffic (and EC2 usage), including daily and weekly patterns. The model needs at least 1 day of historical data to start making predictions. It is re-evaluated every 24 hours to create a forecast for the next 48 hours. The prediction process produces a scaling plan that can drive one or more groups of automatically scaled EC2 instances."},
  { que: "AWS Auto Scaling",
    ans: `A separate service that monitors your applications.It automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that enables you to build scaling plans for resources including:
Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets.
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks.
Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes.
Amazon Aurora Replicas.`},
